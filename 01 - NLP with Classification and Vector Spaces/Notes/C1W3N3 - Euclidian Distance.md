# Euclidian Distance

Let us assume that you want to compute the distance between two points: $A, B$. To do so, you can use the euclidean distance defined as

$d(B,A) = \sqrt{(B_1 − A_1)^2 +(B_2 − A_2)^2}$

You can generalize finding the distance between the two points $(A,B)$ to the distance between an nn dimensional vector as follows:

​$d(\vec{v}, \vec{w}) = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (v_i - w_i)^2}$

Here is an example where I calculate the distance between 2 vectors $(n=3)$.
